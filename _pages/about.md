I am a ??? researcher at ??? where I study computational materials science using high performance computing (molecular dynamics and quantum chemical calculation), statistical physics, and machine learning. 

I graduated with PhD (Engineering) from the Department of Chemical Science and Engineering at Tokyo Institute of Technology. 
For more information, see my CV.

Research interests
======
I am interested in **atomistic-scale transport phenomena** of practical materials, especially soft matters (liquid crystals and polymers) and solid electrolytes. To understand transport phenomena atomistically, I engage in **theoretical development and molecular dynamics simulation**.   

- Molecular simulation
  - Molecular dynamics
  - Quantum chemical calculation
- Atomistic-scale transport phenomena, Statistical physcis
  - Thermal conductivity
  - Diffusion coefficient, Ionic conductivity
  - (Viscosity, Dielectric constant)
- Mesophase materials / Soft matters
  - Liquid crystal, Polymer
  - Solid electrolyte, Highly concentrated electrolyte
